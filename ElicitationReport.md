Eliciting requirements is the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. 
The process of eliciting requirements can be broken down into several steps. Identify stakeholders, The first step in eliciting requirements is to 
identify the stakeholders who will be affected by the software project. Next gather requirements, Once the stakeholders have been identified, the 
next step is to gather requirements from them. Requirements can come from a variety of sources:
- Goals - high-level objectives of the software. Attention needs to be on the goal when considering the value and cost. 
- Domain knowledge - The team needs to have a solid understanding of the domain in which the application is being developed. 
- Stakeholders - All stakeholders must be identified and valued to create successful software. 
- Business rules - these are statements that define or constrain some aspect of the structure or the behavior of the business itself.
- Operational environment - These are requirements that are from the environment in which the software will be executed. Think real-time content 
creation and performance constraints. 
- Organizational environment - Software is often required to support a business process, the selection of which may be conditioned by the structure, 
culture, and internal politics of the organization. The software engineer needs to be sensitive to these since, in general, new software should not force 
unplanned change in the business process.

Once the requirements have been gathered, the next step is to analyze them. This involves breaking down the requirements into smaller, more manageable 
parts, and identifying the dependencies and relationships between them. After the requirements have been analyzed, the next step is to prioritize them. 
This involves identifying the most critical requirements and assigning them a priority level based on their importance to the stakeholders.

Elicitation techniques include:
- Interviews - Asking stakeholders questions to uncover requirements is straightforward but can have its drawbacks. there are scenarios where details may 
be lost, or some features could be overlooked by the stakeholder.  
- Scenarios - Users are asked questions like "what if" and "how is this done" to gain a better idea of how a real situation would play out, the main scenario 
is a use case description. The developers get a better idea of the user's point of view.
- Prototypes - The benefit of a prototype is to give context to the user. The user can provide feedback to clarify ambiguous requirements by better 
understanding the information they need to provide.
- Facilitated meetings - When handled properly, facilitated meetings can provide refined requirements as the group brainstorms and bounce ideas off each other. 
The meetings can also identify where there may be conflicts with the requirements and bring them to light for the stakeholders.
- Observation - Software engineers are able to find requirements by observing a user perform their tasks. 
- User stories - "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>" user stories gather the information that is needed to produce a function within the product.

Eliciting requirements is a critical step in the software development process. By identifying stakeholders, gathering requirements from various sources, analyzing 
and prioritizing those requirements, and using common elicitation techniques such as brainstorming, prototyping, use cases, and observation, the software 
development team can ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders.

The requirements engineering process is a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements of a software system. 
This process is critical to the success of software development projects, as it helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the stakeholders 
and performs as expected. The process supports the elicitation and validation of behavioral requirements by elicicing, analyzing and documenting, and validating
behavioral requirements.

Eliciting behavioral requirements describe the expected behavior of the system in response to different inputs. 
The requirements engineering process includes techniques such as interviews, surveys, and observation to elicit these requirements from stakeholders. 
By involving stakeholders in the process, the team can get a better understanding of the behaviors that the system should exhibit, and the different 
scenarios in which those behaviors should occur. Once the behavioral requirements have been elicited, they must be analyzed and documented. 
This involves breaking down the requirements into smaller, more manageable parts, and identifying the different scenarios and use cases in which those behaviors 
should occur. This process helps to ensure that the requirements are complete, accurate, and consistent with the needs of the stakeholders. Validation of 
the behavioral is the process of ensuring that the requirements are accurate, complete, and consistent with the needs of the stakeholders. This involves checking 
the requirements against the stakeholders' expectations, as well as against the constraints and limitations of the system. The requirements engineering process 
includes techniques such as reviews, inspections, and testing to validate the behavioral requirements. By validating the requirements, the team can ensure that 
the system will behave as expected, and that it will meet the needs of the stakeholders.

The requirements engineering process plays a critical role in the elicitation and validation of behavioral requirements. By involving stakeholders 
in the process, breaking down requirements into manageable parts, and validating the requirements against stakeholder expectations and system constraints, 
the team can ensure that the system will behave as expected and meet the needs of the stakeholders.
  
Requirements elicitation is a critical and challenging aspect of the software development process. It involves identifying, analyzing, and documenting 
the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. One of the most significant challenges of requirements elicitation is effectively 
communicating with stakeholders. Stakeholders may have different backgrounds, knowledge, and expectations, making it difficult to understand and articulate 
their needs. Additionally, stakeholders may not have a clear understanding of what they want or may have difficulty expressing their needs. Another challenge of 
requirements elicitation is scope creep, which refers to the continuous expansion of the project scope as new requirements emerge. Scope creep can lead to 
delays and increased project costs if not managed effectively. Requirements elicitation can be challenging due to ambiguity and uncertainty in stakeholder 
needs and expectations. Stakeholders may use vague or imprecise language, which can lead to misinterpretation of requirements. Stakeholders' needs and expectations 
may change throughout the project lifecycle, leading to changes in requirements. These changes can be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may require 
the team to revisit and update previously gathered requirements. Different stakeholders may have conflicting needs and expectations, making it challenging to 
reconcile and prioritize requirements. Conflicting requirements can also lead to disagreements and delays in the software development process. One challange that can
cultural and social differences among stakeholders can create challenges in requirements elicitation. For example, stakeholders from different cultures may have 
different expectations and ways of communicating, making it difficult to understand their needs.

Requirements elicitation is a complex process that requires effective communication, managing scope creep, dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty, handling 
changing and conflicting requirements, and navigating cultural and social differences. Addressing these fundamental challenges is critical to ensuring the 
success of the software development project.
