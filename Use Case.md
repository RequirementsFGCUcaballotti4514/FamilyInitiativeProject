### Summary
The majority of the throughput in the system will be from the RBT as they will be interacting with the client the most. As they interact with the client
they collect data and enter behavior data for patients undergoing behavioral therapy. 
The RBT must be able to access the software system, input client data, select the appropriate behavior category, record the behavior occurrence and duration, 
and save the data. The RBT must be able to do this quickly and easily, as time constraints can be a factor. 
The system should be designed to allow for easy access and efficient navigation to reduce the time taken to input data. 
The data entered must be accurate and secure, as it will be used by therapists to develop treatment plans. In addition, 
the system should provide appropriate data visualization and reports to enable therapists to make informed decisions 
and track patient progress over time. Overall, the RBT data inputting use-case is critical for effective behavioral therapy and requires a software system 
that is user-friendly, accurate, secure, and provides useful data insights.
